# README
To run the application:

Once the repository is on you machine, in your terminal run ``$ bundle insall``
Run ``$ rails db:migrate``
Run ``$ rails db:seed``
and spin up the server ``$ rails s``

The repository also includes an erd for the application (/erd.pdf) as well as a text file with "would have's" and some edge cases I thought of (/todo_edge_cases.txt).
